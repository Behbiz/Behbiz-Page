  aboutmeTwo:
   "I'm a highly resilient, adaptable and creative Full Stack Developer with versatile skills and critical thinking. I have a daring nature and I am always determined to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth. Last year, for example, I decided to change country, language, culture and profession. I successfully obtained a professional certification in creating and publishing web pages issued by the Spanish government. And, in addition, I completed two bootcamps at the beginning of 2023 that qualified me in several programming languages, including: JavaScript, PHP, Python and their corresponding frameworks, such as ReactJS, Bootstrap, Laravel, Typescript, Vue among others. , I'm very thirsty for knowledge and I'm always willing to learn and teach as a way to keep up to date with the new technologies on the market. In addition, I am a skydiving and diving athlete, and my great differential is my ability to react calmly, originality and effectively in unexpected situations, or in high pressure, always seeking to make assertive strategic decisions.",
